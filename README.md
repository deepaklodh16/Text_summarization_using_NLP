# Text_summarization_using_NLP

In this text summarization project, I utilized NLP techniques to extract information from a PDF file using data scraping libraries like pdfplumber. The extracted data was stored in a new variable. To perform text summarization, I employed NLP libraries such as NLTK and various Python libraries. The initial step involved sentence tokenization, and the ultimate result is a concise summary of the text content.
